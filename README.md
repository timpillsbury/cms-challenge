## Scripting
I have created the 4 components separately based on the arguments passed through the CMSComponent - rendered by CMSPage - in stead of Stringifier component, and these arguments were of course based on the data coming from the ./src/mock-data/page.js .
Ps : if the no type corresponds to those in the mock-data, render by default the stringifier compt.

## Styling
I have just added some basic Scss for each component.

# Bonus task
The seo data are now displayed in meta tags in the HTML header thanks to importing the MetaTags from 'react-meta-tags'

# Bonus Test

I have written some basic tests for each Component using `enzyme`, and a main test for the CMSComponent. 

# How to start:

1. run `yarn install`
2. run `yarn start`
run `npm test` for the Test
